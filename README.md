# Handling-Multiple-Tasks-Across-a-Series-of-Conversations-with-Various-Agent-Pairs


## Overview
This project explores the process of solving multiple tasks through a series of conversations involving different pairs of conversable agents. It focuses on task delegation, context retention, and effective communication between agents.

## File Structure
- `agentchats_sequential_chats.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and analysis of the agent-based conversational task-solving approach.

## Features
- Sequential task handling with different agent pairs.
- Context-aware conversation management.
- Efficient task delegation across multiple agents.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy openai

```

## Usage
Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook agentchats_sequential_chats.ipynb
```
Run the cells sequentially to observe the chat-based task-solving approach in action.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing context-awareness between agent interactions.
- Implementing memory retention for improved sequential conversations.
- Adding real-world use cases to validate the model.
